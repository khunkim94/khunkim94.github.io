          <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
          <h4>Dogs noses are wet to help absorb scent chemicals</h4>
          <p>
            This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog
            owners have. Why are dogs noses wet? Their nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.
